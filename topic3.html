        <h6 class="text">The most dominant religion in Chicago Chinatown is Christianity, with over 31% of the population being Christian.</h6>
        <h6 class="text">The religion diffused through contagious diffusion as a majority of the people in Chicago are Christian. Therfore, it was likely for Chinese-Americans in Chicago Chinatown to adopt Christianity as their dominant religion and make Christianity the dominant religion.</h6>
        <h6 class="text">An intrafaith conflict for Christianity were The Crusades, which were a series of religious wars spanning a period of 250 years. During these wars, Christians from Europe sent out military expeditions to Middle East to fight Muslims for control over “Holy Land” in the Middle East (regions such as Jerusalem). In the year 1291, the final Crusader states were lost to the Muslims, signifying victory for the Muslims.</h6>
