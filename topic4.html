        <h3 class="sT text">Pros of The Development of Ethnic Enclaves</h3>
        <h6 class="text">
            &nbsp- Development of ethnic enclaves can bring diversity to environments and bring new culture/ideas. <br />
            &nbsp- The development of ethnic enclaves can bring in more economic opportunities to the overall environment through things such as job offerings. <br />
            &nbsp- Ethnic enclaves offer services that understand the community’s unique needs and traditions. Families can access healthcare, schools, and social support in a way that feels comfortable and respectful.

        <h3 class="sT text">Cons of The Development of Ethnic Enclaves</h3>
        <h6 class="text">
            &nbsp- While to an extent, ethnic enclaves can be good, they can also socially isolate the enclave itself, form the broader society, which can have limitations with interacting with other cultural groups. <br />
            &nbsp- The development of ethnic enclaves can lead to stereotypes and discrimination of ethnicity of the enclave from the broader society. In this case, Chinese-Americans might face discrimination from Americans outside of Chinatown. <br />
            &nbsp- High demand within enclaves can put pressure on housing, schools, and healthcare services. This can make it difficult for residents to access quality resources and services within their own community. <br />
